# Lab 15 - Configure an Multifactor authentication registration policy

## Lab scenario

Multifactor authentication provides a means to verify who you are using more than just a username and password. It provides a second layer of security to user sign-ins. For users to be able to respond to MFA prompts, they must first register for Microsoft Entra Multifactor Authentication. You must configure your Microsoft Entra organization's MFA registration policy to be assigned to all users.

#### Estimated time: 10 minutes

### Exercise 1 - Set up MFA registration policy

#### Task 1 - Policy configuration

1. Sign in to the [https://entra.microsoft.com]( https://entra.microsoft.com) using a Global administrator account.

2. Open the portal menu and then selectÂ **Microsoft Entra ID**.

3. On the lefthand men, under **Identity**, select **Protection**.

4. On the Security page, in the left navigation, select **Identity protection**.

5. In the Identity protection page, in the left navigation under **Protect**, select **Multifactor authentication registration policy**.

7. Under **Assignments**, select **All users** and review the available options.

8. You can select from **All users** or **Select individuals and groups** if limiting your rollout.

9. Additionally, you can choose to exclude users from the policy.

10. Under **Controls**, notice that the **Require Microsoft Entra ID multifactor authentication registration** is selected and cannot be changed.


#### Task 2 - Configure Microsoft Entra Identity Protection policy for MFA registration

**Note**: Microsoft Entra Identity Protection requires Microsoft Entra ID Premium P2 to be activated. 

1. In the Microsoft Entra admin center, navigate to **Microsoft Entra Identity Protection** in the search bar.

1. Under **Protect** in the menu, select **Multifactor authentication registration policy**.

1. Under **Assignments**, select **All users** under Users, and select a user to enforce MFA.

1. Change **Policy enforcement** from **Disabled** to **Enabled**.

1. Select **Save**.

This will require the user to complete the MFA registration the next time they attempt to login.

1. From a private browser, navigate to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`. Enter a user name and password from the tenant.  Note the additional security information requirements that the user is asked to enter.
