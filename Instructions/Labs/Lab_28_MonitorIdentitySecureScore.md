# Lab 28 - Monitor and managed security posture with Identity Secure Score

### Login type = Microsoft 365 admin

## Lab scenario

Microsoft Entra Identity Protection provides automated detection and remediation to identity-based risks, and provides data in the portal to investigate potential risks. Microsoft Entra Identity Protection also provides an Identity Secure Score to monitor and improve your identity security posture.  In the same manner as Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Identity Secure Score provides improvement actions and recommendations that can improve your overall security posture for identity in Microsoft Entra ID.  This lab will explore this capability. 

**Note** - Since this lab is running on a new created tenant environment, you will probably get an Identity Secure Score of 0.00%.  It takes about 24 hours for valuable data to enter the calculation to give you a valid score.

#### Estimated time: 15 minutes

### Exercise 1 - Using Identity Secure Score to monitor and manage identity security posture

#### Task 1 - Review Identity Secure Score and improvement actions

1. Sign in to the [https://entra.microsoft.com](https://entra.microsoft.com) as a Global administrator.

2. Open the **Protection** menu and select **Identity Secure Score**

3. In the **Overview** tile, you will find **Identity Secure Score**.

4. Select **Identity Secure Score**.  This will take you to the Identity Secure Score dashboard.

5. Scroll down to view the **Improvement actions**.

6. In contrast to the improvement actions in Microsoft Defender for Cloud and Microsoft Defender XDR, these improvement actions are specific to identity.  This provides a more focused list of potential actions to your security posture management.  Any improvement actions initiated from this list will also provide an impact to your overall tenant security posture. 

#### Task 2 - Execute an improvement action

1. To improve one area of the identity security posture, select **Enable Microsoft Entra ID Protection sign-in risk policy**.

2. In the tile that opens, scroll down and select **Get Started**.

3. A new tab will open for **Identity Protection | Sign-in risk policy**.
 **Note** - by default the Get Started button will open in Azure Portal. You can use the portal or return to the Entra admin center. Either wil work.

6. Under Assignments, the **All Users** text.

7. Under Include, select All users.

8. Under Exclude, select Users and groups and choose your **MOD Administrator** account.

  - Microsoft recommends you exclude at least one account to prevent yourself from being locked out.

9. Under Sign-in risk - select the text that says **Low and above**.

10. Choose **Medium and above** then select **Done**.

10. In the **Controls** section choose the text that says **Block access**.

11. Select **Allow access - Require multifactor authentication**.

11. Select Done.

14. Confirm your settings and set policy enforcement to **Enabled**.

15. Select **Save**.
